Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Projects Repository! This repository houses three distinct projects that demonstrate various aspects of machine learning and data science. Whether you're a beginner looking to explore the basics or an experienced practitioner seeking examples for reference, this repository has something for everyone.

Projects Overview
1. Titanic Survival Prediction
Description
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict whether a passenger aboard the Titanic would survive or not based on various features such as age, gender, and ticket class. This classic machine learning task serves as a great introduction to binary classification and feature engineering.

2. Iris Flower Classification
Description
The Iris Flower Classification project focuses on the classification of iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their petal and sepal dimensions. This project is a classic example of a multi-class classification problem and is ideal for understanding the basics of data preprocessing and model evaluation.

3. Movie Rating Prediction
Description
The Movie Rating Prediction project involves building a machine learning model to predict the user ratings for movies. This regression task requires predicting a continuous variable, making it a valuable exercise for those interested in regression techniques and collaborative filtering.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to this repository! If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request.

Happy coding and exploring the world of machine learning! ðŸš€
